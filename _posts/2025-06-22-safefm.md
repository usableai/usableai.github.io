### Description

This project aims to improve automated vehicle safety by developing physics-guided, explainable AI foundation models for predictive modeling and automated test case generation for time series, enabling reliable validation across diverse conditions while reducing dependence on costly physical trials. The approach ensures models remain grounded in real-world physics, enhancing their accuracy, scalability, and practical deployment.
