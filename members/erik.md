### About me

I am a PhD student here at AIXLab working closely with Sahlgrenska University hospital. With a background in Biomedical Engineering here at Chalmers, my main motivation is to develop safe- and usable AI solutions to assist in diagnostics and efficiency for the healthcare sector. I believe that AI can, and will, benefit the healthcare system when used in an ethical way and being able to assist in this transition is truly inspiring!
