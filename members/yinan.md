### About me

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Chalmers University of Technology, Sweden. My research focuses on developing technical solutions to make AI more *usable* and help create a more accessible and sustainable world. 🌍✨

I work extensively with diverse data modalities, including texts, images, and time series. I enjoy organizing and managing data lakes to make data more accessible and searchable for their end-users. I love designing and implementing deep learning techniques for multimodal learning to unlock the full potential of data! 📊🤩
 
By closely collaborating with industry partners, I aim to create research that is both practical and impactful, focusing on sectors such as healthcare 🏥, automotive 🚗, banking 💼, and smart manufacturing 🏭. 

Additionally, I co-founded the startups <a href="https://asymptotic.ai/"> <img src="/assets/img/asymptotic.png" alt="Asymptotic AI" style="width:30px;vertical-align:middle;margin-right:5px;">Asymptotic AI</a> and <a href="https://lumilogic.se/"> <img src="/assets/img/ll-small.png" alt="Lumilogic" style="width:20px;vertical-align:middle;margin-right:5px;">Lumilogic</a>, which operate across various stages of the AI life cycle. These ventures allow us to validate and apply our research in real-world settings -- something I find incredibly rewarding 🚀.
